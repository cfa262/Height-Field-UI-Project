# Height-Field-UI-Project

Design Documentation:

Before creating a mesh field, a user must pick a number of rows and columns using the spin box provided. The depth and width spin boxes can also be applied as well. After the user has chosen all their values, the user then must click on the Create Mesh button and the customized mesh field will be drawn onto the GLWidget window.  With the created mesh, one can choose the number of fractalizations and subdivisions. There is also a random generated height field button that randomizes every verticies on the meshField. For the different views, there are buttons which show the top view which looks the meshField from above and a side view which looks at the meshField from one of the side. The snowCapHeight can also be changed from a shorter point to a higher point to make it look like it has snow on a mountain.
